Versioning
==========

Releases will be numbered with the follow format::

    <major>.<minor>.<patch>

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backwards compatibility bumps the major
* New additions without breaking backwards compatibility bumps the minor
* Bug fixes and misc changes bump the patch

We use even stable odd unstable versioning, e.g. 0.1 would be unstable whereas 
0.2 would be stable.
